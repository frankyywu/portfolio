# Photography

I created a photography book documenting the year 2022 under recurring lockdowns in China. This book has two sides—one for life and the other for life under lockdowns, so when finishing your reading of either life/side you flip it and start the other, just like your life in 2022 in China.

**Online read**: You can access a free copy archived on [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AjtLKGT_AX8QgdxG9m8IAvpzEKyvVg?e=2R6aw5).

**Offline read**: Please visit “Shanghailander Cafe” at 92 Wu-yuan Rd, Xuhui, Shanghai (徐汇区五原路92号) and it is on the bookshelf.

# Neuroscience (2021 - Present)

**Dr. Siyu Zhang’s lab** (link: [ENG](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sii/info/1333/2722.htm) / [CHN](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/cbms/info/1104/4110.htm)) 
Department of Anatomy & Physiology, College of Basic Medical Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University

Since 2021, I have been conducting visual attention neural circuit research in Dr. Siyu Zhang's lab at the School of Basic Medical Sciences, SJTU. I am proficient in using cutting-edge techniques including viral tracing, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, fiber photometry, and optogenetics to reveal neural network functions. Major achievements include a study on transcallosal cross-inhibitory circuits in the ACA brain region, published in *Nature Comm.* as a co-author; and an anatomical and computational neuroscience study on basal forebrain cholinergic system function, soon to be published in *Science Adv.* (manuscript in first revision) as a key co-author—in this study, I independently developed a generalized linear model (GLM) to analyze the dynamic effects of behavioral events on ACh, achieving a breakthrough from zero to one in behavioral computational neuroscience at SJTU School of Medicine.

> 2021年至今，我在交大基础医学院张思宇课题组参与视觉注意神经环路研究。能够灵活运用病毒追踪、电生理学、钙成像、光纤记录技术和光遗传学等前沿技术揭示神经网络功能。主要成果包括一项关于ACA脑区跨胼胝体交叉抑制环的研究，以共同作者身份发表在Nature Comm.；以及一项关于基地前脑胆碱能系统功能的解剖学和计算神经学研究，即将以重要的共同作者身份发表于Science Adv.（稿件在一修）——这项研究中我独立开发了一套广义线性模型用于分析行为事件对ACh的动态影响，为交大医学院在行为计算神经学领域实现从0到1的突破。

# Single-Cell Omics (2022 - 2024)

**Dr. Jian He’s lab** (link: [ENG](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sph-cscomics/info/1137/1476.htm) / [CHN](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sph/info/1131/1591.htm)) 
Center for Single-Cell Omics, College of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University

From 2022 to 2024, I led a bioinformatics study on hepatoblastoma under the guidance of Dr. Jian He, director of the Single-Cell Platform at the Medical School. We completed the analysis of exome expression profiles from Chinese hepatoblastoma patients, discovering significant inter-individual genetic heterogeneity, and developed a novel single-cell transcriptome sample preparation technique that successfully obtained high-quality data, revealing different tumor evolution strategies. This research won awards at multiple academic conferences and competitions. The newly invented sample preparation technique was published in the Cell journal STAR Protocols as co-first author and received high praise from Dr. Mandovi Chatterjee, director of the Single Cell Core at Harvard Medical School.

> 2022年至2024年，我领导了一项对肝母细胞瘤的生物信息学研究，由医学院单细胞平台何牮主任指导。我们完成对中国肝母细胞瘤患者外显子表达谱的分析，发现了显著的个体间基因异质性，并开发了一种新型单细胞转录组样本制备技术，成功获取高质量的数据，揭示了肿瘤进化的不同策略。该研究在多次学术会议和竞赛中获奖。其中新发明的样本制备技术以共同第一作者身份发表在Cell子刊STAR Protocols，并受到哈佛医学院Single Cell Core主任Mandovi Chatterjee教授的高度赞许。
